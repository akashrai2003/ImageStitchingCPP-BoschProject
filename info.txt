Comparing the method of using good features for alignment with pairwise matching depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the images you are working with, as well as the goals of your image processing task. Both methods have their advantages and use cases:

Good Features + Geometric Transformation:
Pros:

Distinctive Points: Good features detection focuses on identifying distinctive points, which are often more robust and repeatable across images.
Explicit Geometric Information: The geometric transformation (e.g., homography) provides explicit information about the spatial relationship between keypoints in different images.
Robustness: Can handle cases where the images have significant viewpoint changes, rotations, and scaling.
Cons:

Limited to Detected Features: This method relies on the detected keypoints, and if the features are not well-distributed or sufficient, the alignment might suffer.
Manual Parameter Tuning: The performance can be sensitive to the parameters of the feature detector and matching algorithm.
Pairwise Matching:
Pros:

Flexible Feature Types: Can work with various types of features (e.g., ORB, AKAZE, SIFT) and descriptors.
Global Consistency: Takes into account information from multiple images simultaneously, potentially leading to more global consistency.
Works with Any Point: Not limited to specific features; any distinctive point can be used for matching.
Cons:

Computational Complexity: Pairwise matching across multiple images can be computationally expensive, especially for a large number of images.
Sensitivity to Outliers: Outliers or incorrect matches can impact the overall alignment.
Conclusion:
Choosing Between Methods: The choice between these methods depends on the characteristics of your images and the specific requirements of your task.
Hybrid Approaches: In practice, a combination of both methods is often used. Detect good features to initialize the alignment, and then refine the alignment using pairwise matching to ensure global consistency.
Library Support: Popular computer vision libraries like OpenCV provide functions for both good features detection and pairwise matching, allowing you to experiment with and combine these methods based on your needs.
