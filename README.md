# ImageStitchingCPP-BoschProject

"Flags:"
        "  --preview"

        "  --ba_refine_mask (mask)"
        "      Set refinement mask for bundle adjustment. It looks like 'x_xxx',"
        "      where 'x' means refine respective parameter and '_' means don't"
        "      refine one, and has the following format:"
        "      <fx><skew><ppx><aspect><ppy>. The default mask is 'xxxxx'. If bundle"
        "      adjustment doesn't support estimation of selected parameter then"
